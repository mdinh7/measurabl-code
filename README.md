# MeasurablCode

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## NOTES

Could combine/fill data for display if given maybe another 30 minutes - 1 hour, need to do more research on how to deal with mutating response data from observables. Spent too long on re-learning project structure in Angular. Both API requests work correctly, but only one data set will show at a time at the moment due to how the data is set up.
